# Bibliotheca Rfid Reader

This is an experimental reverse-engineering project for **Bibliotheca** branded RFID readers (tested with **210** model, but it may work with other readers as well). This library is capable of simple reading and writing RFID tags.

Since I don't have the required equipment on my hands anymore, this project is abandoned.
